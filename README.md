# A Hybrid Book Recommender System Utilizing Diverse-Item Selection Algorithm
Nowadays, a significant number of people find books for academic research, commercial purposes or personal use online since it is more comfortable and efficient way to do so. Nevertheless, the users may still encounter the problem of finding relevant books because some searching and recommending tools might neglect books’ content and others could be focused mostly on books’ ratings and not on the actual topic. The aim of this thesis is to develop a hybrid recommender system which considers book's tables of contents and uses collaborative filtering methods to consider quality of the book in order to present mainly high-quality books. In theoretical part, the student will present an overview of current approaches to book recommender systems. In practical part, the student will design and implement a novel system that will combine algorithms to better address users’ interests and preferences when recommending a book. The system will be validated on sample data to generate recommendations.

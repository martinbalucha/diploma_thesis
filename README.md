# A Hybrid Book Recommender System Based on Table of Contents and Multiple Algorithms Combination
The aim of this thesis is to develop a hybrid recommender system which considers book's tables of contents and uses collaborative filtering methods to consider quality of the book in order to present mainly high-quality books. In theoretical part, the student will present an overview of current approaches to book recommender systems. In practical part, the student will design and implement a novel system that will combine multiple algorithms to better address usersâ€™ interests and preferences when recommending a book. The system will be validated on sample data to generate recommendations.
